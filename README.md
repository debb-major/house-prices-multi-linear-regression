# 📚 House Price Prediction (Multi-Linear Regression)

This project is a beginner-friendly machine learning exploration where I built a **Multiple Linear Regression** model to predict student scores based on various features such as area, bedrooms, and furnishing status.

It builds on my first ML project and was a fun next step in understanding how multiple inputs influence a single outcome.

## 🚀 What This Project Covers
- 📊 Data loading and visualization
- 📈 Multiple linear regression model using scikit-learn
- 📉 Model evaluation using MAE and R² Score
- 🔮 Custom predictions using new input values

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python (via Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda)
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn & matplotlib for visuals
