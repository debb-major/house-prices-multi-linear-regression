# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction - Multiple Linear Regression

This project is a beginner-friendly walkthrough of a multiple linear regression model to predict house prices based on factors like area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and stories.

I had so much fun doing this project! It helped me deepen my understanding of how multiple variables interact in real-world data. 🎯

It builds on my first ML project and was a fun next step in understanding how multiple inputs influence a single outcome.

## 🚀 What This Project Covers
- 📊 Data loading and visualization
- 📈 Multiple linear regression model using scikit-learn
- 📉 Model evaluation using MAE and R² Score
- 🔮 Custom predictions using new input values

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python (via Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda)
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn & matplotlib for visuals
